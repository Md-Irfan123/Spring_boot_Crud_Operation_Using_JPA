the full range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations along with pagination and sorting in your Spring Boot project! Here’s a brief overview of how each of these operations can be managed in Spring Boot:

Create: You typically use POST requests to add new records to the database. In Spring Boot, this is handled using @PostMapping in your controller and saving the entity using a repository like JpaRepository.

Read (GetAllData): You can use GET requests to fetch records from the database. To get all records, you can use @GetMapping, with the repository’s findAll() method.

Update: For updating records, PUT requests are usually used. In Spring Boot, you might use @PutMapping in the controller and repository methods to update an existing entity.

Delete: You can handle deletion using @DeleteMapping with the repository’s deleteById() method or similar.

Pagination: Spring Data JPA makes pagination easy. The Pageable interface, combined with the repository’s findAll(Pageable pageable) method, enables pagination.

Sorting: Sorting can be implemented with the Sort class, which can be passed along with Pageable in the repository's method to handle both pagination and sorting.

** Steps for Handling Exceptions:**

Custom Exception Classes: You can create custom exception classes to represent specific errors in your application. For example, a UserNotFoundException for when a requested resource isn't found:

Global Exception Handler: Use the @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler annotations to create a centralized error-handling mechanism. This will ensure that all controllers in your application share a common response format when exceptions are thrown.
